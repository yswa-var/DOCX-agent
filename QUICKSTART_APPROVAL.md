# 🚀 Quick Start - Human Approval Feature

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Your DOCX Agent now has **human-in-the-loop approval** for all write operations! 

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `state.py`**: Added `pending_operation` field to track operations awaiting approval
2. **Updated `graph.py`**: Added three new components:
   - `approval_node()` - Pauses execution and requests approval using `interrupt()`
   - `route_model_output()` - Routes write operations through approval
   - `route_approval()` - Handles approved/rejected responses
3. **Graph Flow**: Added new node and routing logic

### Graph Flow:

```
User Query
    ↓
call_model (LLM decides what to do)
    ↓
    ├─ Read tools? → Execute directly
    └─ Write tools? → 🛑 approval_node (INTERRUPT & WAIT)
                          ↓
                      ┌─────────┬─────────┐
                      │ YES ✅  │  NO ❌  │
                      ├─────────┼─────────┤
                      │ Execute │ Cancel  │
                      └─────────┴─────────┘
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Method 1: Using LangGraph Studio (Recommended)

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/yash/Documents/rfp/DOCX-agent/main
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
   langgraph dev
   ```

2. **Open Studio:** http://localhost:8123 (or the URL shown in terminal)

3. **Test Write Operation (Requires Approval):**
   
   Send this message:
   ```
   Update section 2.1 to say "Company Overview"
   ```
   
   **Expected Result:**
   - The agent will **pause** and show an approval request
   - You'll see details about the operation:
     ```
     **Update Operation**
     - Location: ["body", 0, 0, 0, 95]
     - New text: Company Overview
     
     Do you approve this change? (yes/no)
     ```
   
   **Approve by typing:** `yes`, `y`, `approve`, or `true`
   
   **Reject by typing:** `no`, `n`, `reject`, or `false`

4. **Test Read Operation (No Approval):**
   
   Send this message:
   ```
   Show me the document outline
   ```
   
   **Expected Result:**
   - The agent will **immediately** show the outline
   - No approval needed for read-only operations ✅

### Method 2: Using Python SDK

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client
from langgraph_sdk.schema import Command
import asyncio

async def test_approval():
    client = get_client(url="http://localhost:8123")
    
    # Create a thread
    thread = await client.threads.create()
    thread_id = thread["thread_id"]
    
    # Request an update (will trigger approval)
    print("🔄 Requesting update...")
    result = await client.runs.wait(
        thread_id,
        "agent",
        input={
            "messages": [{
                "role": "user", 
                "content": "Update section 2.1 to say 'Company Overview'"
            }]
        }
    )
    
    # Check the interrupt
    if "__interrupt__" in result:
        print("\n🛑 Approval Required!")
        print(result["__interrupt__"][0]["value"]["description"])
        
        # Approve the operation
        print("\n✅ Approving...")
        result = await client.runs.wait(
            thread_id,
            "agent",
            command=Command(resume="yes")
        )
        
        print("\n✅ Result:", result)

# Run the test
asyncio.run(test_approval())
```

## 📝 What Operations Require Approval?

Currently configured in `graph.py` line 77:

```python
WRITE_TOOLS = {"update_paragraph"}
```

### Add More Tools:

To require approval for other operations, edit `graph.py`:

```python
WRITE_TOOLS = {
    "update_paragraph",      # ✅ Enabled
    "delete_paragraph",      # Add when implemented
    "insert_paragraph",      # Add when implemented
    "replace_section",       # Add when implemented
}
```

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Approve an Update ✅

```
User: Change the title to "Updated RFP Response"
Agent: 🛑 [Shows approval request with details]
User: yes
Agent: ✅ Successfully updated the title!
```

### Scenario 2: Reject an Update ❌

```
User: Delete all pricing information
Agent: 🛑 [Shows approval request]
User: no
Agent: ❌ Operation cancelled by user. The update_paragraph operation was not executed.
```

### Scenario 3: Read Operations (No Approval) 👁️

```
User: Show me section 3
Agent: [Immediately shows section 3 - no approval needed]
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Operations

```
User: Update section 2.1 to say "Company Profile" and then show me the result
Agent: 🛑 [First requests approval for update]
User: yes
Agent: ✅ Updated! Here's the result: "Company Profile"
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Approval Message Format

Edit `graph.py`, around line 140:

```python
if tool_name == "update_paragraph":
    anchor = tool_args.get("anchor", [])
    new_text = tool_args.get("new_text", "")
    description = (
        f"**Custom Approval Request**\n"
        f"📍 Location: {anchor}\n"
        f"📝 New text: {new_text}\n"
        f"⚠️ This will modify the document.\n\n"
        f"Type 'approve' to proceed or 'reject' to cancel."
    )
```

### Accept Different Approval Phrases

Edit `graph.py`, around line 167:

```python
# Add your own approval keywords
if approval in ["yes", "y", "approve", "approved", "true", "ok", "confirm"]:
    # Approval granted
    return {"pending_operation": None}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "NameError: name 'approval_node' is not defined"

**Status:** ✅ Fixed!

**What was wrong:** Graph building code was placed before function definitions.

**Fix applied:** Moved graph building to the end of the file.

### Problem: Approval not triggered for updates

**Check:**
1. Is `update_paragraph` in `WRITE_TOOLS`? (line 77 of `graph.py`)
2. Is the LLM calling the right tool? Check the conversation history.

### Problem: Can't resume after approval

**Solution:** Make sure you're using LangGraph Studio or the SDK with checkpointer enabled.

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Test it now!** Start `langgraph dev` and try the examples above
2. **Customize approval messages** for your use case
3. **Add more write tools** to the approval list
4. **Implement audit logging** to track all approvals/rejections
5. **Add role-based approvals** (future enhancement)
